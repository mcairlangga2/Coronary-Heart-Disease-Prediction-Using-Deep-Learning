# Coronary Heart Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning
This repository is an implementation of deep learning for coronary heart disease prediction directly from the ECG signal. This is a part of project called "Student's Creativity Program" held by The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Indonesia. In this project, me and my team implement a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for predicting coronary heart disease. This networks predict the abnormality in the ST segment of ECG signal consist of ST Depression and Elevation. This CNN is made using TensorFlow and Transfer Learning method with the basic architecture is taken from VGG16 model. At the end, this architecture was implemented on Raspberry Pi 4, so the resulting model should be converted to TFlite.
